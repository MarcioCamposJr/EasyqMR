**Open-source computational tool for formulating parametric maps in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.**

EasyqMR is an open-source software developed by Inbrain Lab, designed to simplify the analysis of MRI data and the generation of parametric maps. With EasyqMR, you can perform various tasks, including:

- **Two-dimensional visualization of primary images**
  - Easily visualize and explore your MRI data in 2D.

- **Brain extraction**
  - Automatically extract the brain region from MRI images for more focused analysis.

- **Coregistration of images**
  - Precisely align different MRI scans to enable comparative analysis.

- **Generation of T2 parametric map**
  - Quickly generate T2 parametric maps from your MRI data.

- **Two-dimensional visualization of parametric maps**
  - Visualize parametric maps in 2D for detailed analysis and interpretation.
